# inline-console
Easily adds a JavaScript debugging console to the bottom of the page (creating an inline developer console). 

Built in browser consoles like you see in Chrome/FireFox are far better then this. However, this can be handy in situations where the browser does not provide a developer console, like with iOS's mobile safari. 

To use this:
* Simple place the inline-console.js file in your web project (somewhere like /js/vendor if you are using something like HTML5Boilerplate.com).
* add this line to any page you want to add the inline developer console too: 
```javascript
<script src="/inline-console.js"></script>
```
That's it. Refresh your page and the developer console will appear at the bottum of the page.
